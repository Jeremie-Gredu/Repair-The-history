intro:
sms- scientist:
Hey, we finished building the time machine. You can come to do the testing. it's in the alley behind the bar, go in the basement.

scientist: 
Hi, thanks for coming. Today is the big day, we finally test the time machine! I'm so excited.

As you know, normally you would try to investigate the truth of a certain historical event in the period and location we've decided.

But today we just calibrate the machine! So, you will go to the 5th of June 8B50 and take a newspaper with you when you come back.

Try to take some notes of events you encounter, like what was this bar before it opens.

when you have finished the mission, join the extraction point to ZZ9-plural-Z-apha

[the scientist go to the controls]

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, please don't modify the past, we're not sure of the consequences it can have.
[the scientist activate the machine]
[sound and visual for the time travel]
