sms- scientist:
Hey, we finished building the time machine. You can come to do the testing. it's in the alley behind the bar, go in the basement.

scientist: 
Hi, thanks for coming. Today is the big day, we finally test the time machine! I'm so excited.

As you know, normally you would try to investigate the truth of a certain historical event in the period and location we've decided.
But today we just calibrate the machine! So, you will go to the 5th of June 8B50 and take a newspaper with you when you come back.
when you have finished the mission, join the extraction point to ZZ9-plural-Z-apha

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, please don't modify the past, we're not sure of the consequences it can have.
[the scientist activate the machine]
