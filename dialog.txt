scientist: 
Hi, thanks for coming. Today is the big day, we finally test the time machine! I'm so exited.

As you know, normaly you would try to investigate the truth of a certain historical event in the period and location we've decided.
But today we just calibrate the machine! So, you will go to 8B50 5 june and take a newspaper with you when you come back.
when you have finished the mission, join the extraction point to ZZ9-plural-Z-apha
