history book:
-Before the war, the yellows organized a raid in our territory. They stole a QF 4.7-inch canon and loads of munitions from one of our storage facilities in the east. Fortunately, they didn't stumble upon the prototypes of our mobile artillery vehicles.

-In the heart of the conflict, the yellows used a restricted weapon. the chemical shells caused a lot of casualties in our ranks. the newspapers titled "the cold-blooded deployment of every device of modern science"
to make things worse, a lot of the injured soldiers will suffer from permanent disfiguration. and a high risk of complications due to their exposure to the chemicals.

-During a quiet time between two assaults, when our troops were regrouping for an assault with a new weapon, the yellows regrouped their prisoners and lined them up in a field. Then with little care, coldly executed their prisoners.
